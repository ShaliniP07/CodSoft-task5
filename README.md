To build a Contact Book System
## Description/Working of code:
1. First, the necessary modules are imported: tkinter for creating the GUI and pickle for saving and retrieving the contact information.

2. A Contact class is defined. This class will have methods for creating, displaying, and saving contact information. The contact information will include fields such as first name, last name, phone number, and email.

3. A ContactBook class is also defined. This class will be responsible for creating the GUI interface, managing contact information, and implementing the functionality for adding, deleting, and updating contacts.

4. In the ContactBook class, the tkinter methods for creating GUI components are used. This includes creating labels for input fields, creating input fields for contact information, creating buttons for adding, deleting, and updating contacts, and creating a listbox to display contact information.

5. The ContactBook class also includes methods for handling user interactions with the GUI. These methods include defining what happens when the user clicks the 'Add Contact' button, the 'Delete Contact' button, the 'Update Contact' button, and the 'Exit' button.
